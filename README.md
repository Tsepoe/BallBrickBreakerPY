This game is a ball and brick game. I obtained the code from Phaser Content Kit by @3r, changed the language from Script to Python, and added touch controls. The primarily involves collisions between ball and bricks. Each collision changes the background color and awards points, with additional points if two or more bricks are broken Players have three and if they are exhausted, the game is over.
